=head2 Apache2::Filter

The following used to confuse due to multiple MARK_FILTER instances
with the same ID.

Remember that if the connection is
C<L<$c-E<gt>keepalive|docs::2.0::api::Apache2::Connection/C_keepalive_>>
) and the connection filter is removed, it won't be added until the
connection is closed. Which may happen after many HTTP requests. You
may want to keep the filter in place and pass the data through
unmodified, by returning C<Apache2::Const::DECLINED>. If you need to reset the
whole or parts of the filter context between requests, use the
L<technique based on C<$c-E<gt>keepalives>
counting|docs::2.0::user::handler::filters>.

=head1 Trailing Verbatim
