and personalizable mode.

By default the HTML generated is simillar to CPAN style for module
documentation.

See POD for more...

An example of the use of this module can be found in the script directory, 
as podhtmleasy.pl.  A more elaborate example may be found in the CPAN author

INSTALLATION 

Standard install

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

RUNNING TESTS

"make test" works fine, to run tests with prove or perl from the package
directory, add "-I blib/lib" or "-I lib" to the command line.
Say "setenv DUMPHTML 1" to get per-test HTML output in files.
